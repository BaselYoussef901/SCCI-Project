# SCCI-Project
this repo contain only what i did in SCCI student activity

This was my first Web Project, and was my first time work in a teamwork. It was great for working with a team on a project that none of us knew anything about and how to be done or organize the project into tasks and so on but all on all it was great opportunity to meet and work with my team
Thanks to them all just for knowing them.
